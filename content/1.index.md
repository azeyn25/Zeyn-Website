#description
Based in Berlin, Born in Giza. I'm a weaver of visual narratives, a craftsman of web development, and a seeker of ancient wisdom as a former Egyptologist. My journey into the heart of photography spans a decade, during which my work has been showcased in exhibitions of Egypt and Germany.

My lens is drawn to the untamed theatre of the streets, magnetized by the complexities of human nature. I strive to illuminate the profound psychological tapestry of our existence, exploring the essence of what it means to live, and the poignancy of human suffering. Through my work, I seek to provoke thought, inspire empathy, and reveal the universal truths hidden in everyday life.
