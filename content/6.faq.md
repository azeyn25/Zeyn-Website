## About the Prints

### What type of paper do you use?
I use premium archival papers from renowned manufacturers like Hahnemühle and Canson. The specific paper depends on the image and your preference:
- **Fine Art Paper**: Smooth matte finish, museum-quality
- **Canvas**: Textured surface for a more artistic feel  
- **Metallic Paper**: Enhanced contrast and vibrant colors

All papers are acid-free and designed to last 100+ years without fading.

### Are the prints signed?
Yes, every print is personally signed by me in pencil on the border. Limited editions also include edition numbering (e.g., 15/25).

### What sizes are available?
Standard sizes include:
- **A4** (21 × 29.7 cm) - €45
- **A3** (29.7 × 42 cm) - €85  
- **A2** (42 × 59.4 cm) - €145
- **A1** (59.4 × 84.1 cm) - €245

Custom sizes are available upon request. Contact me for pricing on non-standard dimensions.

### How accurate are the colors?
I use a calibrated monitor and professional printer to ensure color accuracy. However, colors may appear slightly different on various devices. If color accuracy is critical for your space, I can provide a small color sample for €5 (credited toward your order).

## Ordering & Payment

### How do I place an order?
Simply browse the galleries, click on any image you like, select your preferred size and material, then add to cart. Complete your purchase through our secure Stripe checkout.

### What payment methods do you accept?
We accept all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express) and some local payment methods through Stripe. All transactions are secure and encrypted.

### Do you offer payment plans?

### Can I purchase prints in person?
Yes! I'm based in Berlin and offer studio visits by appointment. This allows you to see the prints in person and discuss framing options. Contact me to schedule a visit.

## Shipping & Delivery

### How long does shipping take?
- **Germany**: 3-5 business days (standard), 1-2 days (express)
- **EU**: 5-7 business days (standard), 2-3 days (express)
- **International**: 7-14 business days (standard), 3-5 days (express)

Processing time is additional: 3-5 business days for standard orders.

### What if my print arrives damaged?
If your print arrives damaged, contact me immediately with photos of the damage. I'll arrange for a replacement at no cost to you. All prints are fully insured during shipping.

## Limited Editions & Authenticity

### What makes a print "Limited Edition"?
Limited editions are restricted to a specific number of prints (usually 25-50). Once sold out, that image will never be printed again in that size, making your print more exclusive and potentially more valuable over time.

### How do I know my print is authentic?
Every print includes:
- My personal signature in pencil
- Certificate of authenticity with holographic seal
- Edition number (for limited editions)
- Care and provenance information

### Can you create custom prints?
Yes! I offer custom printing services for:
- Non-standard sizes
- Special paper types
- Unique framing requirements
- Corporate or exhibition needs

Contact me with your specific requirements for a quote.

## Care & Framing

### How should I care for my print?
- Handle with clean hands or cotton gloves
- Avoid touching the image surface
- Store flat in a cool, dry place
- Keep away from direct sunlight
- Use UV-protective glass when framing

### Do you offer framing services?
While I don't frame prints myself, I can recommend trusted local framers in Berlin and provide specific guidance for your piece. Many customers prefer to frame locally to avoid shipping risks.

### How long will my print last?
With proper care and archival materials, these prints are designed to last 100+ years without noticeable fading. The inks and papers I use meet museum conservation standards.

## Returns & Exchanges

### Can I return my print?
Yes, I offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely happy with your print, you can return it for a full refund (excluding custom sizes unless defective).

### What if I ordered the wrong size?
Contact me within 30 days and I can often arrange an exchange. You'll be responsible for return shipping, and any price difference between sizes.

### Do you offer refunds?
Full refunds are available for:
- Defective or damaged prints
- Prints that don't match the description
- Returns within 30 days in original condition

## Technical Questions

### What camera equipment do you use?
I primarily shoot with professional digital cameras, but specific equipment varies by project. The focus is always on the artistic vision rather than the gear.

### Are these prints reproductions?
These are high-quality digital prints of my original photographs. Each image was captured by me and printed using museum-quality processes and materials.

### Can I see the print before buying?
If you're in Berlin, you can visit my studio by appointment. For distant customers, I can provide detailed images or small samples for a nominal fee.

## Licensing & Commercial Use

### Can I use these images commercially?
Print purchases are for personal use only. For commercial licensing, editorial use, or publication rights, please contact me separately. Licensing fees vary based on usage.

### Can I resell my print?
Yes, you own the physical print and can resell it. However, you cannot reproduce or create copies of the image. The resale market for photography prints can be quite strong, especially for limited editions.
